PomodoroTimer
=============

A simple pomodoro timer, used for the [pomodoro technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)
There are so many pomodoro timers out there that it was simpler to make one than to find one which suits my needs.  

This one plays a subtle ticking sound while it is counting down.  
I like it more this way because it reminds me to stay focused.
